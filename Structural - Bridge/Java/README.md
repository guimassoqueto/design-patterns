## Bridge in Java

### Bridge between devices and remote controls

This example shows separation between the classes of remotes and devices that they control.

Remotes act as abstractions, and devices are their implementations. Thanks to the common interfaces, the same remotes can work with different devices and vice versa.

The Bridge pattern allows changing or even creating new classes without touching the code of the opposite hierarchy.
